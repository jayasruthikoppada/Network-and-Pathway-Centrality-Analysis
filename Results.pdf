# Results
The analysis identified 1,062 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls:
- 774 upregulated genes (e.g., `ISG15`, `IFITM3`): Indicate activation of antiviral response pathways.
- 288 downregulated genes (e.g., `DUSP1`, `EIF2AK2`): Suggest cellular resource shifts toward combating the virus.

### Key Findings
- Notable Genes:
  - Upregulated: `ENSG00000278771`, `ENSG00000130176`
  - Downregulated: `ENSG00000224607`, `ENSG00000200795`
  - These genes may play critical roles in COVID-19 severity and represent potential therapeutic targets.

- WGCNA Analysis:
  - Identified gene modules associated with disease severity:
    - Positively Correlated Modules:
      - Likely involved in inflammatory responses and immune system activation.
    - Negatively Correlated Modules:
      - Suggest potential protective mechanisms or pathways suppressed in severe cases.

- Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment:
  - Highlighted pathways such as:
    - Mitotic nuclear division, chromosome segregation, and cytoskeletal organization.
  - Cellular components enriched include `spindle`, `condensed chromosome`, and `kinetochore`.

- KEGG Pathway Enrichment:
  - Strong enrichment in:
    - `Cell cycle regulation` and `p53 signaling pathway` (linked to apoptosis and DNA repair).
    - Broader impacts on cell division and stress response pathways.
  - Highlighted impacts on the immune system (e.g., `Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection`).

# Network Analysis
- Gene Interaction Network (via Cytoscape):
  - 55 nodes and 1,435 edges reveal dense connections between genes.
  - Centrality Measures:
    - `PLK1`, `KIF14`, `CDK2`: Identified as critical hub genes influencing molecular effects across pathways.
    - These genes play significant roles in the biological processes related to COVID-19 progression.


- Highlighting pathways for future investigation into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and immune response.
